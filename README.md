# Mechanical Aimbot
CS:GO Aimbot using Computer Vision and 2 Axis Joystick Control

## Usage
To use some of the scripts inside the package you must add the directory
containing the mechbot folder to the python search path.
Run the platform specific `add_to_path` file to do so.

Then run `python3 -m mechbot` to run the full app.
Use `python3 -m mechbot --help` for all options.
